## 1. Overview
This is a ROS 2 package for DeRO, written in C++. DeRO utilizes 4D point cloud measurements from a millimeter-wave Frequency-Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar and IMU measurements to estimate the robot's poses. Specifically, Doppler velocity and gyroscope measurements are used to calculate odometry, while the radar's range and accelerometer measurements are utilized to update the estimation using a Stochastic Cloning Extended Kalman Filter (SCEKF).

## 2. Prerequisites
- Ubuntu 20.04.
- [ROS2 Foxy](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Installation.html).
- Open-source datasets for reproducing the paper's results can be downloaded from [here](https://christopherdoer.github.io/datasets/icins_2021_radar_inertial_odometry).
- This package was tested with ```C++14```, ```PCL 1.10.0```, and ```Eigen 3.3.7```.

## 3. Build
- Clone the repository and build:
```cmd
mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/src
cd ~/ros2_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/hoangvietdo/dero
cd ..
colcon build
```

Note: There will be some warnings, but just ignore them.

## 4. Run
- Choose the dataset you want to run on (e.g., Carried 1, Carried 2, etc.) and convert the ROS1 bag to ROS2 bag using ```rosbags-convert```.
- Change the value of ```est_save_dir``` and ```bag_dir``` in the corresponding launch file (e.g., ```dero_carried_1_ros2bag.launch.py``` (proposed method) or ```rio_carried_1_ros2bag.launch.py``` (compared method))
- In 1st terminal: Execute the launch file
  ```cmd
  ros2 launch dero dero_carried_1_ros2bag.launch.py
  ```
- In 2nd terminal: Open the rviz config file ```config/dero_carried_1.rviz``` using
  ```cmd
  rviz2
  ```

## 5. Evaluation
- We use a modified version of [rpg_trajectory_evaluation](https://github.com/hoangvietdo/rpg_trajectory_evaluation) for verifying the filter's performances.
- By default, the .txt file generated from ```est_save_dir``` is already compatible with the aforementioned toolbox.
- The pseudo-ground truth is given in ```results/carried_datasets/laptop/```.
